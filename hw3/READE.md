2. b.
From the graph above When alpha is small it converges slower. For alpha of 0.005 and 0.001 is not enough for it to converge in 50 iterations. However for large alphas convergence happenes much faster. Alpha of 1.0 converges with less than 10 iterations. It should also be noted that if the alpha is larger than optimal, it may bounce off as it comes closer to the optimal point and possibly never converge. On the other hand if the alpha is too small, it would take more than practical time to converge.
